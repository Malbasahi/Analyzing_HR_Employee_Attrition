Introduction:
Employee attrition, the phenomenon of employees leaving a company, is a significant concern for organizations. High attrition rates can lead to increased costs and disrupt productivity. To address this issue, the HR Employee Attrition project aims to analyze and understand the factors contributing to attrition within a company.

The primary goals of the HR Employee Attrition project are:
Identify the main factors influencing employee attrition.
Provide actionable insights to reduce attrition and retain talent.
Create data-driven recommendations for HR policies and strategies.

# Scope:
The project will focus on the analysis of employee data, which may include demographics, job-related information, satisfaction levels, and more. Data cleaning, exploration, and visualization will be carried out to uncover patterns and trends.

# Key Objectives:
The project will involve the following key objectives:

Data Cleaning: Remove redundancies, rename columns, handle missing values, and remove duplicates from the dataset.

Exploratory Data Analysis: Analyze the dataset to identify key trends and relationships, such as correlations between variables.

Data Visualization: Create visualizations to represent data, including correlation maps and various plots to understand the impact of different factors on attrition.

Identify Key Factors: Determine the most significant factors contributing to attrition, such as overtime, job role, marital status, and more.

Recommendations: Provide actionable recommendations to address attrition based on the analysis and insights.

Data Export: Save the cleaned data for future reference.

# Tools and Methodology:
The project will utilize Python programming with libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for data analysis and visualization. Statistical analysis and machine learning techniques may be applied to predict attrition.

# Stakeholders:
